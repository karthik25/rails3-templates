Rails 3 Templates
---------------------

This template installs rspec for tests, will_paginate or kaminari for pagination and default bootstrap or one of bootswatch. To use enter the following 
command

```
rails new app_name -T -m rails3-templates\main.rb
```

(in the top level folder where you need the app folder to be present)

After the app is created, cd to directory

```
cd app_name
```

And then run the server

```ruby
rails server
```

That's it! You are all set :) Navigate to http://localhost:3000/home/index, you will see the app running with the selected bootswatch (or default
bootstrap) theme! Have fun!!!
